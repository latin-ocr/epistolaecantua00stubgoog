Agatho to S. Erkenwald, which, although not free from
suspicious characteristica, hes greater claim to be received

·as genuine. There 'is also a similar grant of pope Con-

stantine to the monasteries of Bormondsey and Woking,
which is found in the Black book of Peterborough,¹ and
which, as 110 monasteries are known from other sources
to have existed at those places before the Conquest, is
exposed to very slight presumption of forgery. The two
last-mentioned privileges arc in strong contrast with the
lavish bestowals of independence that appear in the later
and forged charters of exemption. The convente are to
elect their own abbots, but the canonical power of the
hishop of the diocese is not· to he infringed: the epi-
scopal examination must he passed before the abhot can
receive henediction. The bishop is carefully excluded
from interiering with the administration of the monastic
property. The exemption was supposed to make the mo-
nastery independent of the diocesan, but did not make
it dependent on the court of Rome. It is probable
that to this extent, and no further, the independcnce of
the monasterics reached before tho Conquest. After thet
event the foreign system of exemptione was occasion-
elly introduced, the greater ahbeys hy either forged or
genuine privileges actually aequired independcnce, and
the smaller ones hy affiliating themselves to one of the
new orders, such as those of Oluny or Clteaux, which
were dependent on a chief abbot oron a general chapter,
and through them on the pope alone, placed themselves
and were frequently strong enough to maintain them·
selves in a similar position. These houses neither were
in obedience to the bishops nor contributed to their
revenues in synodals and procuratione, nor could the
hishop celebrate mass or hold synod in them without
permission.
