X INTBODUCTION.

ffpffiiyoyo Only fifty years passed between the enuctment of the

yffivp constitutions of Clarendon and the surrender of the

offlam-f kingdom by John to pope Innocent ΙΙΙ. One life of

iffi& ordinary length might witness the martyrdom of S,
Thomas aud the suspension of Stephen Langton What
were the prooesses by which the changed attitudes of
parties and the altered appearances of principles were
brought about? Wae the differenoe ascribable only to
the inferiority of John to Henry, of Thomas to Ste-
phen, of Alexander to Innocenti What was the direc-
tion, the impetus, the initial force os the undercurreut
that made it possible for such changes to be wrought
by such ment What was the share of Richard, of
Urbau, Clement, and Celestine‚ of archbishops Baldwin
and Hubert, of Ranulf Glauvill, William Longchamp,
or Geoffrey riez-Petere For an answer to such ques-
tions the student must look, like the archaeologist,
below the surface of political history. In 1164 he finds
king, bishops, and barone on one side, the archbishop
and the inferior clergy on the other, the pope end the
people either uninterested observers or half-hearted
partinens. 1111215 he finds the king and the pope
allied against the church end the people. We welcome
any trastworthy details which, however unimportant‚
help to show how the different estates of the realm
stood to one another, to the pope, and to the king at
a fixed period iu the meanwhile, and to indicate the
variatione in their combinatione, the causes of their ¹
mutual attraction and repulsion.
