Badrin The first measure taken hythe archbishop was to
fficium procure a letter from the pope, Lucius ΙΙΙ, ¹ empowering

the alienatione 111 question had been confirmed by Alex·
ander ΙΙΙ, and by Lucius himself.2 It was uncertain
how far such a permission would be allowed to be velid
in opposition to the papal privileges which might he
adducod by the convent3 but there could be no doubt
that if the archbishop had prooeeded without it, he
would have put himself out of court at once. Of thece
alienated possessione the principel ones were the obla·

archbishop,³ and the four churches appropriated to the
almonry, Monkton, Eastry, Mepeham, and Eynesford,
and these had been confirmed to the convent by th'e
holy see. The alienatione which had not been so con-

coming in direct conflict with the court of Rome. His
mensures would probably be appceled against, but
when the appeal was once admitted, the price of jus·
