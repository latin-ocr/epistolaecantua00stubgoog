bishop’s charges, being closely watched that he might
not be tempered with by the convent. The monks
succeeded in getting a private interview with him, at
which Baldwin, who saw that nothing was to be feared
from him, probably connived. He informed the monks
that the king had told him of the compromise, by which

kept a profonnd secret, and reserved for future use.²
The king left England for the crusade on the llth of
December.⁸ The archbishop remained in the country
