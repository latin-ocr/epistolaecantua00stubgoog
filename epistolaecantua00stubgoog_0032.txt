usage of canonioal life came into fashion, they took,
as a matter of course, the name of canons. In this
way it happened that, whilst the nearly-founded sees
of AngloSaxon bishops were placed in secular churches,
the original settlements of the first missionary hishops
retained a monastic character. Canterbury was thus
monastic, although Rochester and Lond0n‚ founded as
episcopal sees within seven years, were secular cathe-
drals. Lindisfurne continued monastic, but York was
a minster of clerks. The mother church of Mercia was
the monastery of Diome, but Lichfield and Hereford,
and, as far as πο know, Leicester, Dorohester, and Wor-
cester, were from the beginning rn the hands of clerks.1

a secular cathedral lived as abbot in his own house
and presided as hishop in the church.² In the further
stage of the decline of monachiam the churches came

almost entirely into the possession of the hishops’ clerks.
