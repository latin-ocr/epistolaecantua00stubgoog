matically as might he wished, in the history of Roger
Hoveden3 Giraldus treats largely, if not fully, of the
second; the last and least important had its own his·
torian in Adam of Domerham. Of the Ooventry dis·
puto unfortunately very few particulare are now ascer-
tainable; but this is less to be regretted as the same
principles were involved and the same actore employed
in it as in the (lanterbury appeal, which is the priu-

subject of a distinct work by abbot Alau of Tewkes·
bury, the collector of the letters of S. Thomas, which
is known only bya short extract preserved iu the
History of the abbey of Evesham.¹

it seems to acquire significance from the abundance ot'
its recorda ; whilst those, matters of vast importance,
and even as affordiug material for the study of cha-

racter, of interest far beyond it, arc presented to us
