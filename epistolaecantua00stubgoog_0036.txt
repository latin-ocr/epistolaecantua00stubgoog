there were probably other reasons for the changes in·
troduced shortly before and after the Conquest, the rule
that a claim to superior ascetic sanctity entirely super-
seded all the rights of property and prescription, was
acted upon, if not by those Norman and Lotharingian
bishops,¹ who attempted to force the use of a common
dormitory and refectory on their reluctant canona, cer-
tainly by Gundulf in his reforms at Rochester and
William of S. Carileph at Durham.

not altogether spontaneous Itis even possible that the ’

Wiuehester bishop Walkelin made a vigorons effort to
expel the monks, which was only defeated by a papal
letter forbidding him to molest them.³ A similar
letter⁴ is extant, addressed to Lanfranc in reference to
changes reported to bc in contemplation at Canterbury.

that he organized the cathedral establishment on the

the prior and the rest of the unmarried canons accepting
