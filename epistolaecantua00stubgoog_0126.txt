runcones or the pacification of England during Richard's captivity
irhbdiif' ⁸ and in the management of the election of J ohn.¹ On the
former of these occasions it is almost amusing to remark
the way in which the minor actors who had acquired
some importance in the medley, vanish before his strong
and sensible proceedings. William of Longchanip
dwindles down into the king's chancellor3 Walter of
Coutances disappears almost entirely from the arena of
English politics; Hugh of Puiset and Hugh of Nunant
are compelled to keep order; John and Geoffrey are
both put in their proper places; Richard reigns aa
powerfully from Spires or Worms as he did from
Roche d'Andeli or Arai. Hubert was himselfa Norman
nobleman, and allied with the greatest names of the
period of amalgamation. He had stood face to face
with Saladin both in the field of battle and in the
council. He who knew how to keep the lion-hearted

king in something like order, was not likely to cower .
before a fellow noble. He tras not, perhaps, the best
conceivable minister l'or Richard‚ but he was probably
· the bestii not the only one, possible. He was a true
patriot, a man of honest purposes, andos pure life.
That such a man should have the authority he had with
Richard is enough to outweigh any charges that cau bo
brought against him as a minister, and the details of
the association bring out some of the better features of

the king’s character at the same time.

‚u aa If we regard him as a bishop, other considerations
⁰' come in. The exchequer of a Norman sovereign could
hardly be a good school of financial honesty, much
less of theological training. Hubert was sadly deficient
in both the scholarship and the doctrinal learning ,that
become a bishop. The secular occupations to which

he devoted himself could not be satisfactorily pursued
