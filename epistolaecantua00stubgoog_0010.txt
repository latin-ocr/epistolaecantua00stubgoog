. The works to be published in notave, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task

resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen hythe

Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, after a eareful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a

lheasury Minnio, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for thc accomplishment of this important
rational object, inan effeetual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
be paid to economy, in making the detailed arrange-
ments, without unnecessary expense.'' '

lhey expressed their approbation oi thc proposal that
each chroniclo and historical document should be edited
in such a manner as to represent with all possible cor-

- rectness the text of each writer, derived from a collation

of tho best MSS, and that no notes should be added,
except such as were illustrative of the various readings.
They suggested, however, that the preface to each work
should contain, in addition to the particulare proposed
by the Master of the Rofls, a biographioal account of
the author, so far as authentic materiale existed for that
purpose, and an estimate of his historica-l eredibility and
velue.
