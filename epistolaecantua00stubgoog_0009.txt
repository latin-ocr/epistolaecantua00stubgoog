THE DIRECTION ΟΡ Tua NASTER OF THE Rotae.

Ox the aoth of J anuary 1857, the Master of the Rolls
submitted to the Troasury a proposal for the publication
oi materials for the History of this Country from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Hemy VIII.

The Mastcr of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer·
enee being given, in the first instance, to such materiale
as -were most scarce and valuablo.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical docu·
ment to be- edited should be treated in the same way as
il the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; and
lor this purpose thc most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation of the best Mss. '

To render the work more generally useful, the Mastcr
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of tho Mas. employed by him, of their ago and
their peculiarities3 that hc should add to tho work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 hut no

other note or comment was to be allowed, except what >

might be necessary to establish the correctness of tho

text.
