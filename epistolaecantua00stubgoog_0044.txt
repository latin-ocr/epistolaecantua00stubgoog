cniraeoeorficiency in the studies 01 the day.¹ According to
moe Giraldus (lambrensis,l who knew him well, although it ι

-is not easy to say how far he speaks the truth, he was

an austere, melancholy man, slow to anger and tempe·

rate in the show of it, wanting in severity and firm-

ness. Alexander Llewelyn, the crosa-bearer of the

martyr, used 10 say 01 the three archbishops whom he

account, if they cannot excuse it. He adapted himself

perhaps too easily 10 the quickly changing circumstances

of his life, and 00 failed 10 carry out in his higher

position the hopes and promise which had led to his

would have ensured him a much more quiet life, and,

considering the circumstances of his death, might have

entitled him to canonization, The errors of temper,
