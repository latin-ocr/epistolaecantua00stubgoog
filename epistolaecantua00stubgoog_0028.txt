The ninth century m England, until· the reign of

Alfrcd, is a blank as to learning, sanctity, or practical
activity. Swithun, the one saint of the period, is vastly
more mythical than the most obscura os the heroes of

the two preceding centuries. Learning had reached the

point at which, south of Humber,·it was hard to find a

man who could read Latin.¹ Devout men spent their

active energies in pilgrimages to Rome rather than in

doing their duty 3 and when the Danes came in force,

they fell on an enervated and almost defeneeless people.
Monachism, for good or for evil, had become (so far
