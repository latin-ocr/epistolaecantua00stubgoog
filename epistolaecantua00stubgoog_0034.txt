It continued a monastery in name, but of its clergy
some were and some were not under monastic vows.
Although the later monkish historiens contended that
all the archhishops up to the Conquest were monks,
it is certain from Bede and from the Chronicle that
they were not uniformly so. Under variatione in the
characters of the rulers of the church, the double cha-
racter of the archiepiscopal familia may well have
been maintained, so long as no jealousies sprung up
between the two constituente, and there was work
enough for both. It is not easy to say at what period
the monastic discipline at Christ Ohurch became extinct
Early, however, in the ninth century we find archbishop
Wulfred showing his familia to possess houses of their
own within the monastery,¹ and to dispose of them
hy will among their brethren, a state of things quite
incompatible with the rigour of Benedictine rule. The
pontificate of Ceolnoth (833 to 870) is the date fixed
by the monastic historiens for the so-called usurpation
of the cathedral by secular clerks. According to this
story, the number of the monks having heen reduced
by sickness to five, the archhishop ordered his chaplains
and the priests of the city to assist in divine service
until he could properly supply the vacancies.³ This
the continuance of war prevented him from doing,
and AEthelred his successor was defeated in a like pur· ,
pose. After nearly two centurias of secular occupatior

archbishop AElfric succeeded in restoring the mouks,
but of these all but four are said to have shared the

martyrdom of S. AElphege.³ From 1012 to 1070 a
