mm. of Exeter, Baldwiu's kinsman,¹ could find ample room

illidii„ sor regret that the great revenues should be spent on

wa idle and luxurious monks, which might maintain a
university of able and useful students3 with such a
plea Baldwin himself had much sympathy, and thc
poverty of the infant universities presented a disagree·
able contrast to the riches of the monasterias. But
the statesmen, the court bishops‚ and clerical lawyers
were the bitterest enemies of the monks, whom they
regarded as the avowed maintainers of an alien juris·
diction in the country, as the greatest supporters of
dangerous and disreputable immunities, and as insur-
mountable obstacles to an equal and uniform admini-
stration of justice. Both king and church were from
time to time exasperated by the claim of the monks
to elect the primate, a claim which they looked upon
as a dangerous innovation, and which, if granted, might

lead to arepetition of the miseries of the struggle be·

tween Henry and Thomas. Urged by these, the arch·
bishop began his attaek upon the convent, and, advised
by these, he conducted his approaehes by those crooked
ways in which a man cannot walk at once honestly
and successfully.2
